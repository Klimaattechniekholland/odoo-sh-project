workflow by generating structured PDF documents for quotations, invoices and
service contracts. The module adds fields for marketing kits, subsidies and
other contract information.

## Module Installation

Copy the `custom_sale_document` directory into your Odoo `addons` path and
update the app list. After installation you can configure additional fields on
sale orders, invoices and kits. The provided QWeb templates serve as a starting
point for custom PDF layouts.
